# CallFoodNow: Food delivery app

CallFoodNow is my personal project to practice coding React Native UI and integrating Google Map API, Google Direction API to the mobile app. I also design UI by myself, with inspiration from map functionality of some well-known delivery apps. This app allows users to order their favorite dishes and keep track of the shipper's location. More features will be developed in detail later.
